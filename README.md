# Network-of-Occurrences
Network of Ocurrences (NoO) is a meta-architecture that relates words by interweaving the same words, forming probabilistic networks that help AI to identify patterns in words and respond in a very efficient way. It can achieve brutal efficiency with very little training data, because it is not a non-relational architecture but rather a multiple connection architecture (MCA).
